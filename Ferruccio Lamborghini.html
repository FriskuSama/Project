    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>Ferruccio Lamborghini was an Italian entrepreneur and the founder of the Lamborghini sports car company. He was born in 1916 in a small village in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy
        After serving in the Italian Air Force during World War II, Lamborghini started his own business, which initially produced tractors. His company, Lamborghini Trattori, became one of the largest agricultural equipment manufacturers in Italy and was highly successful.
        In the early 1960s, Lamborghini became interested in sports cars and began to build his own, with the goal of creating a car that was even better than the Ferrari models he owned. He founded Automobili Lamborghini in 1963 and introduced his first car, the 350 GT, the following year.
        Lamborghini was known for his entrepreneurial spirit and determination. He was a perfectionist and had a deep knowledge of mechanics and engineering. He was also known for his distinctive style and love of luxury, owning a number of high-end cars, yachts, and planes.
        In 1974, Lamborghini sold his stake in the company due to financial difficulties and later retired to his estate in Umbria, Italy. He died in 1993 at the age of 76, but his legacy lives on in the cars that bear his name, which continue to be coveted by car enthusiasts around the world.</p>
