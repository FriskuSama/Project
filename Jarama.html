    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>The Lamborghini Jarama is a high-performance grand tourer produced by the Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1970 and 1976. It was named after a district in Madrid, Spain, which is known for its bullfighting.</p>
    <p>The Jarama features a front-engine layout and is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter V12 engine, which produced 350 horsepower in the later models. It was available with both manual and automatic transmissions.</p>
    <p>The Jarama's exterior design was characterized by clean lines and a classic GT car profile, with a long hood and a sloping rear end. The interior was spacious and comfortable, with high-quality materials and a focus on luxury rather than sportiness.</p>
    <p>The Jarama was designed as a more practical and comfortable alternative to Lamborghini's more extreme sports cars, such as the Miura and the Countach. It was intended to be a fast and comfortable grand tourer that could be used for long-distance driving and daily use.</p>
    <p>Although it was not as successful or iconic as some of Lamborghini's other models, the Jarama is still considered to be an important part of the brand's history and a unique and interesting car in its own right.</p>
