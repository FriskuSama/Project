     <h3><strong>History:</strong></h3>
     <p>Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, who was a successful tractor manufacturer before venturing into the sports car industry. Lamborghini was inspired to create high-performance sports cars after he became dissatisfied with the quality of the Ferrari cars he owned, and he wanted to create something that was even better.
        Lamborghini's first car, the 350 GT, was introduced in 1964 and was well-received for its sleek design and powerful V12 engine. The company continued to produce successful sports cars over the next few decades, including the iconic Miura, which was introduced in 1966 and became known as one of the most beautiful and revolutionary cars of its time.
        In the 1970s, Lamborghini faced financial difficulties and was sold to various owners. However, the company continued to produce notable cars such as the Countach and the Diablo, which were popular among car enthusiasts.
        In the 1990s, Lamborghini was acquired by the Volkswagen Group and was able to increase its production capabilities and expand its model range. The company continued to produce high-performance sports cars, including the Murcielago, the Gallardo, and the Aventador.
        In recent years, Lamborghini has also expanded into the production of luxury SUVs, with the introduction of the Urus in 2018. Despite its ownership by a larger corporation, Lamborghini has maintained its reputation for producing unique and high-quality sports cars with distinctive Italian style and engineering.</p>
