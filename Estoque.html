    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>The Lamborghini Estoque is a concept car that was first unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. It is a four-door supercar that was designed to showcase Lamborghini's ability to produce high-performance vehicles that are also practical and functional for everyday use.</p>
    <p>The Estoque features a front-engine layout and is powered by a 5.2-liter V10 engine, which produces 560 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. The car is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission and Lamborghini's all-wheel-drive system, providing excellent traction and handling in all driving conditions.</p>
    <p>The exterior design of the Estoque is characterized by sharp, angular lines and a low, aggressive stance. The car features a long hood and a short rear deck, giving it a classic sports car silhouette. The interior is designed to be both luxurious and comfortable, with premium leather and Alcantara materials throughout the cabin.</p>
    <p>One of the most notable features of the Estoque is its four-door layout, which makes it more practical and functional than many other high-performance supercars. Despite its larger size, the Estoque is still able to deliver excellent performance, with a top speed of 200 mph and a 0-60 mph time of just 4.5 seconds.</p>
    <p>While the Lamborghini Estoque was originally conceived as a concept car and was never intended for production, it represented a significant departure from Lamborghini's traditional two-door supercar designs. It showcased the brand's ability to innovate and adapt to changing consumer needs and preferences, while still maintaining its commitment to high-performance and luxury.</p>
